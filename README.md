# Browserify-TypeScript-Angular-Gulp--Boilerplate

To get started run the following commands:

- npm install
- bower install
- gulp serve

To get a list of available gulp commands, just type gulp.

- The boilerplate's build task collects your application code and 3rd party dependencies into their own js bundles and creates the corresponding mapping files. 
- CSS files are handled in the same manner. 
- HTML templates are cached in a separate js file.


This repository contains two branches: 
  - no-demo-app (just boilerplate code)
  - master (contains a small CRUD demo app)
    * the application features controllers and directives as ES6 modules
    * interfaces, classes, enums, arrow functions
